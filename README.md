Like notepad but without all the modern bells and whistles.
It's literally just an edit box with no other features.

## Future possibilities

If people have an interest in this then there are a few features that would be useful while still keeping it minimal.

- The undo/redo feature of edit controls is very anaemic. We could reimplement our own.
- Font selection. Or at least some way to increase/decrease font size.
- A stausbar! I'd want to keep this limited but it may be useful.
- A menubar! Ditto.
- Word wrap option.
- Load and save txt files. The point of this is to be minimal but perhaps lacking this feature is going too far.
- Crash recovery. Many people seem to want notes to be ephemeral but it would be nice to have some kind of recovery if the worst should happen.
